(This section uses \"set of Listeners\" rather than\n\"Listeners in a single Gateway\" because implementations MAY merge configuration\nfrom multiple Gateways onto a single data plane, and these rules _also_\napply in that case).\n\n\nPractically, this means that each listener in a set MUST have a unique\ncombination of Port, Protocol, and, if supported by the protocol, Hostname.\n\n\nSome combinations of port, protocol, and TLS settings are considered\nCore support and MUST be supported by implementations based on their\ntargeted conformance profile:\n\n\nHTTP Profile\n\n\n1. HTTPRoute, Port: 80, Protocol: HTTP\n2. HTTPRoute, Port: 443, Protocol: HTTPS, TLS Mode: Terminate, TLS keypair provided\n\n\nTLS Profile\n\n\n1. TLSRoute, Port: 443, Protocol: TLS, TLS Mode: Passthrough\n\n\n\"Distinct\" Listeners have the following property:\n\n\nThe implementation can match inbound requests to a single distinct\nListener. When multiple Listeners share values for fields (for\nexample, two Listeners with the same Port value), the implementation\ncan match requests to only one of the Listeners using other\nListener fields.\n\n\nFor example, the following Listener scenarios are distinct:\n\n\n1. Multiple Listeners with the same Port that all use the \"HTTP\"\n   Protocol that all have unique Hostname values.\n2. Multiple Listeners with the same Port that use either the \"HTTPS\" or\n   \"TLS\" Protocol that all have unique Hostname values.\n3. A mixture of \"TCP\" and \"UDP\" Protocol Listeners, where no Listener\n   with the same Protocol has the same Port value.\n\n\nSome fields in the Listener struct have possible values that affect\nwhether the Listener is distinct. Hostname is particularly relevant\nfor HTTP or HTTPS protocols.\n\n\nWhen using the Hostname value to select between same-Port, same-Protocol\nListeners, the Hostname value must be different on each Listener for the\nListener to be distinct.\n\n\nWhen the Listeners are distinct based on Hostname, inbound request\nhostnames MUST match from the most specific to least specific Hostname\nvalues to choose the correct Listener and its associated set of Routes.\n\n\nExact matches must be processed before wildcard matches, and wildcard\nmatches must be processed before fallback (empty Hostname value)\nmatches. For example, `\"foo.example.com\"` takes precedence over\n`\"*.example.com\"`, and `\"*.example.com\"` takes precedence over `\"\"`.\n\n\nAdditionally, if there are multiple wildcard entries, more specific\nwildcard entries must be processed before less specific wildcard entries.\nFor example, `\"*.foo.example.com\"` takes precedence over `\"*.example.com\"`.\nThe precise definition here is that the higher the number of dots in the\nhostname to the right of the wildcard character, the higher the precedence.\n\n\nThe wildcard character will match any number of characters _and dots_ to\nthe left, however, so `\"*.example.com\"` will match both\n`\"foo.bar.example.com\"` _and_ `\"bar.example.com\"`.\n\n\nIf a set of Listeners contains Listeners that are not distinct, then those\nListeners are Conflicted, and the implementation MUST set the \"Conflicted\"\ncondition in the Listener Status to \"True\".\n\n\nImplementations MAY choose to accept a Gateway with some Conflicted\nListeners only if they only accept the partial Listener set that contains\nno Conflicted Listeners. To put this another way, implementations may\naccept a partial Listener set only if they throw out *all* the conflicting\nListeners. No picking one of the conflicting listeners as the winner.\nThis also means that the Gateway must have at least one non-conflicting\nListener in this case, otherwise it violates the requirement that at\nleast one Listener must be present.\n\n\nThe implementation MUST set a \"ListenersNotValid\" condition on the\nGateway Status when the Gateway contains Conflicted Listeners whether or\nnot they accept the Gateway. That Condition SHOULD clearly\nindicate in the Message which Listeners are conflicted, and which are\nAccepted. Additionally, the Listener status for those listeners SHOULD\nindicate which Listeners are conflicted and not Accepted.\n\n\nA Gateway's Listeners are considered \"compatible\" if:\n\n\n1. They are distinct.\n2. The implementation can serve them in compliance with the Addresses\n   requirement that all Listeners are available on all assigned\n   addresses.\n\n\nCompatible combinations in Extended support are expected to vary across\nimplementations. A combination that is compatible for one implementation\nmay not be compatible for another.\n\n\nFor example, an implementation that cannot serve both TCP and UDP listeners\non the same address, or cannot mix HTTPS and generic TLS listens on the same port\nwould not consider those cases compatible, even though they are distinct.\n\n\nNote that requests SHOULD match at most one Listener.

(This section uses \"set of Listeners\" rather than\n\"Listeners in a single Gateway\" because implementations MAY merge configuration\nfrom multiple Gateways onto a single data plane, and these rules _also_\napply in that case).\n\n\nPractically, this means that each listener in a set MUST have a unique\ncombination of Port, Protocol, and, if supported by the protocol, Hostname.\n\n\nSome combinations of port, protocol, and TLS settings are considered\nCore support and MUST be supported by implementations based on their\ntargeted conformance profile:\n\n\nHTTP Profile\n\n\n1.

When multiple Listeners share values for fields (for\nexample, two Listeners with the same Port value), the implementation\ncan match requests to only one of the Listeners using other\nListener fields.\n\n\nFor example, the following Listener scenarios are distinct:\n\n\n1. Multiple Listeners with the same Port that all use the \"HTTP\"\n   Protocol that all have unique Hostname values.\n2. Multiple Listeners with the same Port that use either the \"HTTPS\" or\n   \"TLS\" Protocol that all have unique Hostname values.\n3. A mixture of \"TCP\" and \"UDP\" Protocol Listeners, where no Listener\n   with the same Protocol has the same Port value.\n\n\nSome fields in the Listener struct have possible values that affect\nwhether the Listener is distinct. Hostname is particularly relevant\nfor HTTP or HTTPS protocols.\n\n\nWhen using the Hostname value to select between same-Port, same-Protocol\nListeners, the Hostname value must be different on each Listener for the\nListener to be distinct.\n\n\nWhen the Listeners are distinct based on Hostname, inbound request\nhostnames MUST match from the most specific to least specific Hostname\nvalues to choose the correct Listener and its associated set of Routes.\n\n\nExact matches must be processed before wildcard matches, and wildcard\nmatches must be processed before fallback (empty Hostname value)\nmatches. For example, `\"foo.example.com\"` takes precedence over\n`\"*.example.com\"`, and `\"*.example.com\"` takes precedence over `\"\"`.\n\n\nAdditionally, if there are multiple wildcard entries, more specific\nwildcard entries must be processed before less specific wildcard entries.\nFor example, `\"*.foo.example.com\"` takes precedence over `\"*.example.com\"`.\nThe precise definition here is that the higher the number of dots in the\nhostname to the right of the wildcard character, the higher the precedence.\n\n\nThe wildcard character will match any number of characters _and dots_ to\nthe left, however, so `\"*.example.com\"` will match both\n`\"foo.bar.example.com\"` _and_ `\"bar.example.com\"`.\n\n\nIf a set of Listeners contains Listeners that are not distinct, then those\nListeners are Conflicted, and the implementation MUST set the \"Conflicted\"\ncondition in the Listener Status to \"True\".\n\n\nImplementations MAY choose to accept a Gateway with some Conflicted\nListeners only if they only accept the partial Listener set that contains\nno Conflicted Listeners. To put this another way, implementations may\naccept a partial Listener set only if they throw out *all* the conflicting\nListeners. No picking one of the conflicting listeners as the winner.\nThis also means that the Gateway must have at least one non-conflicting\nListener in this case, otherwise it violates the requirement that at\nleast one Listener must be present.\n\n\nThe implementation MUST set a \"ListenersNotValid\" condition on the\nGateway Status when the Gateway contains Conflicted Listeners whether or\nnot they accept the Gateway. That Condition SHOULD clearly\nindicate in the Message which Listeners are conflicted, and which are\nAccepted. Additionally, the Listener status for those listeners SHOULD\nindicate which Listeners are conflicted and not Accepted.\n\n\nA Gateway's Listeners are considered \"compatible\" if:\n\n\n1. They are distinct.\n2. The implementation can serve them in compliance with the Addresses\n   requirement that all Listeners are available on all assigned\n   addresses.\n\n\nCompatible combinations in Extended support are expected to vary across\nimplementations. A combination that is compatible for one implementation\nmay not be compatible for another.\n\n\nFor example, an implementation that cannot serve both TCP and UDP listeners\non the same address, or cannot mix HTTPS and generic TLS listens on the same port\nwould not consider those cases compatible, even though they are distinct.\n\n\nNote that requests SHOULD match at most one Listener. For example, if\nListeners are defined for \"foo.example.com\" and \"*.example.com\", a\nrequest to \"foo.example.com\" SHOULD only be routed using routes attached\nto the \"foo.example.com\" Listener (and not the \"*.example.com\" Listener).\nThis concept is known as \"Listener Isolation\".
